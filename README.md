# Demo Project

Hi everyone, my name is Jose Acosta, and I am excited to present my project:
This application is built with React Native using Expo. I have enhanced it with additional features to make it more interactive and secure.

### Features

- Interactive Charts: View dynamic charts with various filters for a better user experience.
- Stock and Company Search: Easily search for stocks and get the company information.
- Search History: view or remove your search history, with sensitive information securely stored using the "Expo Secure Store" package.
- Light and Dark Mode Themes: The app defaults to the system theme but allows manual toggling via a button in the profile tab.
- Animated Components: Enjoy a more engaging experience with smooth animations throughout the app.

**Note**: If the API rate limit is exceeded, the app will automatically return static data to ensure continued functionality and user experience.
